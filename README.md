# PROBLEM STATEMENT​

- To develop a decentralized CrowFunding Web based Application, so that people can contribute in a crowdfund and to eliminate the middle men.
- People can raise there Campaign and Notify about the total amount that is to be collected.
- This will be a total Decentralized app which will be deployed on Ethereum network

## Objectices

- To eliminate the middle men by making the CrowdFunding application deployed on the Ethereum network​

- To provide a free platform for funding for a certain campaign,so that there wouldn’t be a fee cut in a certain donation​

- To make the smart contract using solidity,then using truffle framework to deploy it on ganache network using web3.js and Metamask for the transaction purpose and atlast building the web dev part which can be in react or html,css,bootstrap​

- Also,making a secure platform for the process so that there can’t be any attacks​

- Also, we would try to implement some schemes that would reward the donor if he is a regular member.This is the first instance of our web application,we can improve this in future.​
